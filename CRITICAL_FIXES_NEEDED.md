# CRITICAL: Users Are Paying for Broken Features

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Users have PAID for the AI Financial Planner but it's not working!**

### Missing OpenAI API Key - CRITICAL
1. Go to Supabase Edge Function Secrets: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aqjcnnrijtivfcidrckr/settings/functions
2. Add secret: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
3. This will fix the AI Financial Chat feature immediately

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Payment system works (users can pay)
- ‚ùå AI Financial Planner (main feature) shows errors
- ‚ùå Chat interface non-functional
- ‚ùå Users getting "Failed to get AI response" errors

### Quick Test:
Visit /dashboard ‚Üí Strategies tab ‚Üí Try typing in AI chat
Currently shows: "Sorry, I had trouble processing your message"

## Temporary Fix Applied:
- Enhanced error handling in AI chat
- Added fallback responses for common questions
- Users now get helpful responses even without OpenAI API

## Still Needed:
1. Configure OPENAI_API_KEY in Supabase secrets
2. Test AI chat functionality
3. Update Planner page to use functional chat component
